\item Tree: a connected undirected graph with no cycles
\pause
\begin{example}
\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.6, every node/.style={scale=0.5}]

\draw (C) to (F);
\draw (E) to (C);

\item Forest: one or more trees (my favorite definition in th whole book)

\item Rooted tree: same, but one node is `special'
\pause
\begin{example}
