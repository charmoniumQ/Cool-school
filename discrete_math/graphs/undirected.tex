\begin{itemize}
\pause
\item A bunch of vertices and a bunch of edges: \pause $G = (V, E)$

\inote{In math notation, this is two sets, one called $V$ and one called $E$}

\pause
\item Vertex: literally anything \inote{AKA `nodes'}

\pause
\item Edge: a set containing one or two vertices \inote {AKA `links'}

\inote{Why do we allow edges to have only one vertex? Could it have zero?}

\pause
\item We can draw graphs, but a drawing is just \alert{one interpretation} of a graph

\pause
\item Position doesn't matter, vertex-names do
