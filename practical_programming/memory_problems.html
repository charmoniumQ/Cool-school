<h1 id="memory-problems-in-c">Memory Problems in C</h1>
<p>Estimated time: 40 minutes. Let me know if I&#39;m wrong.</p>
<p>Language: C</p>
<p>Objective: to introduce you to the tools for debugging memory
errors. Knowing your tools makes you a 10x more productive programmer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a novice performing automotive repair, I can struggle for hours
trying to fit my rudimentary tools (hammer, duct tape, wrench,
etc.) to the task at hand. When I fail miserably and tow my jalopy
to a real mechanic, he invariably fishes around in a huge tool
chest until pulling out the perfect gizmo which makes the job seem
effortless.</p>

<ol>
<li>The following program crashes at line D, however removing any of
these seemingly unrelated lines, A, B, or C cause the program to
succeed. Why is this? Experiment and write down your guess.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-C">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

typedef struct {
    char * file;
    size_t line; // A
    char * type; // B
    size_t size;
} entry_t;

int main() {
    entry_t* entry = malloc(sizeof(entry));

    entry-&gt;size = 10; // C
    entry-&gt;file = &quot;file&quot;;
    printf(&quot;%s %d\n&quot;, entry-&gt;file, entry-&gt;size); // D

    free(entry);

    return 0;
}</code></pre>
<p>Since this crash is undefined behavior, it is possible that on your
compiler and OS, something different happens. I tested this in GCC
with Linux, and I believe this behavior should be generalizable to
other 64-bit environments, but it might not be. Let me know if this
doesn&#39;t work. The rest of the exercise will still work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Install valgrind.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>gcc -g program.c -o program.exe
valgrind ./program.exe</code></pre><p>If valgraind is not an option (e.g. if you have Windows), compile the program with address sanitization (ASAN):</p>
<pre><code>gcc -fsanitize=address -g program.c -o program.exe
./program.exe</code></pre><p>This compiles in address bounds checking to your Now try executing
<code>program.exe</code>. Was your guess correct?</p>
<p>Valgrind output:</p>
<div class="spoiler">

<p>I ran the program with no modifications. This is what catches my eye:</p>
<pre><code>==16725== Invalid write of size 8
==16725==    at 0x10916F: main (memory_problems.c:15)
==16725==  Address 0x4a3d058 is 16 bytes after a block of size 8 alloc&#39;d
==16725==    by 0x109166: main (memory_problems.c:13)</code></pre><p>On line C, it looks like <code>entry-&gt;size</code> points to an address that isn&#39;t
writable (hence invalid write). So <code>entry</code> does not point to a valid
<code>entry_t</code>. I don&#39;t yet know why. Take another look at its
construction, which is the other line that Valgrind flagged.</p>
</div>

<p>ASAN output:</p>
<div class="spoiler">

<p>I ran the program with line A removed. The relevant output is here:</p>
<pre><code>SUMMARY: AddressSanitizer: heap-buffer-overflow ./memory_problems.c:15 in main</code></pre><p>This must mean that <code>entry</code> was not properly constructed. It does not point to 24 bytes (24 is the size of the struct) of empty data.</p>
</div>

<ol start="4">
<li>These tools lead us to the actual error. Was your guess correct?</li>
</ol>
<div class="spoiler">

<p><code>malloc(sizeof(entry))</code> should be <code>malloc(sizeof(entry_t))</code>.</p>
</div>

<ol start="5">
<li>Explain why this line of code matters.</li>
</ol>
<div class="spoiler">

<p>In the incorrect version, C won&#39;t allocate enough memory for an <code>entry_t</code>.</p>
<p><code>sizeof(entry)</code> (i.e. <code>sizeof(entry_t*)</code>) is 8 (as are all pointers),
but <code>sizeof(entry_t)</code> is 24. This means that the first field, <code>file</code>
points to 8 bytes of empty memory. This explains all of the observed
behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>accessing <code>size</code> causes a crash because <code>size</code> exists at <code>entry +
20</code> which is invalid if <code>entry</code> points to a block of 8 free bytes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>removing either member variable A or B shifts the struct up by 4 or
8 bytes respectively. The program for whatever reason has some empty
data after <code>entry</code>, so <code>entry-&gt;file</code> (<code>entry + 12</code> or <code>entry + 16</code>)
accesses that memory. This is not valid because we are writing
someone elses memory, but it does not crash.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a silly typo. In C, it never makes sense to write <code>Type*
object = malloc(sizeof(object));</code> In an ideal programming language,
the programmer would not have to repeat the type that they are
mallocing.</p>
</div>

<ol start="6">
<li>Can this same kind of bug happen in C++ (with <code>new</code>)?</li>
</ol>
<div class="spoiler">

<p>No.</p>
<p>We would write </p>
<pre><code>entry_t* entry = new ____;</code></pre><p>The blank has to be filled in with a type-name, not a variable
name. Furthermore, <code>new T</code> evaluates to a <code>T*</code> so it can only be
assigned to variables of type <code>T*</code>. The problem is that the return
type of <code>malloc</code> is <code>void*</code> which allows for no typechecking at
all.</p>
<p>That&#39;s one reason some poeple prefer C++ to C.</p>
