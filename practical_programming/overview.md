# Practical programming

I am going to create questions and puzzles designed to build your
knowledge of practical programming. Most of these can be done in any
language you choose, but some of them will be specific to a certain
language.

You can put in as much or little time as you want, and you can learn
with us in realtime (like a course with recommended 'due' dates) or do
this all a year from now. I think you will get more out of it if you
follow along. I won't make this work very heavy at all.
