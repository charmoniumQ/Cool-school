# Cool-school

I'm writing curriculum for fun.

## Discrete math lessons
- [Graphs](https://github.com/charmoniumQ/Cool-school/raw/master/discrete_math/graphs.pdf) (intro)
- [Induction](https://github.com/charmoniumQ/Cool-school/raw/master/discrete_math/induction.pdf) (intro)
- [Languages and machines: the meaning of language and the limits of computation](https://github.com/charmoniumQ/Cool-school/raw/master/discrete_math/languages_and_machines.pdf) (more advanced)

## Physics lessons
- [Tensors (for physics)](https://github.com/charmoniumQ/Cool-school/raw/master/physics/tensors/main.pdf)

## Practical programming lessons

Questions and puzzles designed for people who already know how to program.

- [Memory problems in C](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/charmoniumQ/Cool-school/blob/master/practical_programming/memory_problems.html&fbclid=IwAR14JF-tDGLzy0iMAPdhPAyjuKmZSdzZSqGpet300XRCXf3qDdWZDV1ZM_Q)

## Systems

- To come later
